The attached file is an engagement monitoring sheet of a program, which includes 3 interventions: 
Recorded Lectures, Speak-Up Kalpana (SUK) Sessions, and MasterClass Sessions.                                    
Each has a total number of hours and a percentage of attendance across all weeks(Week 0 to Week 8) 
as well as overall attendance across all weeks.                                                                                                                       

In this case, we need the data insights in the form of graphs and 
dashboards indicating the performance (in each intervention & the whole program) of the users from various  -
                                                                                                        
- Annual Family Income brackets                                               
- City categories                                         
- Subject Areas (BE/Bsc etc.)                                                          
- Assigned categories (Full paid, Scholarship, Stem Champions, Foreign Students)                                           
                                                     
Good To Have:                                             
                                                
1. Engagement Summary: Dashboard with 5-8 important parameters in one place.                                                                                   
	An example of a parameter will be listing the top 3 SUK sessions where 
	you will have to decide a method to rank the SUK sessions.                                                                                      
	Is the no. of students attending relevant or total watch time important for ranking the sessions or something else?                                                                                                 
2. Which intervention out of the 3 was the most favored and why? (Graph)                                                     
3. If you will have to cut a few parts of the program that will not work, which one will you remove? Why?                                                            
                                                                                                                           
You can create graphs and dashboards using any visualization tool of your choice, 
including Power BI, Tableau, and Pivot tables in Excel.                                                                                                           
You can also use R or Python for data visualization. Please submit your assignment by December 5 as a file or a link.
